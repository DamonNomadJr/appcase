Welcome to App Case,
Here you can install, update, and view all the apps available
for your Ubuntu distributed operating system.
The basic commands are:
	- install: to install application
	- update: to update your system, done automatically while
	the program starts
	- apps: lists all applications available to install
	- about: views the applications' detail
	- exit: to end the program
Thank you for using this small application that I have created.
